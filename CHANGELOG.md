## [2.0.0]

Compatibility with Popit importer broken!
Due to changes in how Links and Sources are modeled, the Popit 
importer is not working any longer.

### Added
- Area class refined
- Area class shortcuts methods implemented and tested
- AreaRelationship class added to map generic relationships among Areas
- Classification added for 
- Links, Sources and Classifications are related to generic objects through *Relâ€¦classes, in order to minimize 
  unnecessary repetitions in the tables.

### Changed
- Common methods and testcases oved into Dateframeable and DateframeableTestCase

  start and end dates are extended.

  comparisons.
