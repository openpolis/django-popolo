Welcome to the documentation for django-popolo!


**django-popolo** is a django-based implementation of the
`Popolo's open government data specifications <http://popoloproject.com/>`_.

It is developed as a Django reusable app to be deployed directly within Django projects.

It will allow web developers using it to manage and store data according to Popolo's specifications.

The standard sql-oriented Django ORM will be used.

From release 1.2.0, django-popolo includes classes that extend the model, although compatibility
with the standard is kept.

Release 2.0.0 introduces a change in how Sources and Links are referred to,
that breaks compatibility with the popit importer.

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file for more details.

Notes on mysociety's fork
-------------------------
`mysociety/django-popolo <https://github.com/mysociety/django-popolo>`_ is a fork of this project where integer IDs are used
instead of slugs.

Our packages, since version 1.1 also uses numerical ids as primary keys for all entities.
Slugs are available as non-primary fields, for the 4 main classes (``Person``, ``Organization``, ``Post``, ``Membership``).
Slugs are used through the ``Permalinkable`` behavior, that adds the ``slug`` field to the class, populating it according to rules defined in each class.
